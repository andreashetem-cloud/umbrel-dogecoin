#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sourced by umbrelOS before this app starts, and before docker-compose.yml is
# rendered.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
#
# umbrelOS regenerates app-data/<app>/docker-compose.yml from the app store on
# every install and every update. Anything typed into the running copy — the
# payout address, the merged-mining switch, the Litecoin RPC password — is
# therefore lost the next time the app updates. The failure is quiet in the
# worst way: the app comes back up mining only Dogecoin, or refuses to start,
# hours after the person who changed the setting has stopped watching.
#
# umbrelOS does NOT create or overwrite app-data/<app>/.env. So that file is
# where device-specific settings belong, and this script is what carries them
# into the environment that renders the compose file. The compose file reads
# them as ${PAYOUT_ADDRESS:-} and friends.
#
# It is also the only place a Litecoin RPC password can live without ending up
# in a git repository.
#
# Example ~/umbrel/app-data/doge-dogecoin-solo/.env:
#
#     PAYOUT_ADDRESS=D...
#     MERGED_MINING=1
#     LTC_PAYOUT_ADDRESS=L...
#     LTC_RPC_PASSWORD=...
#
# Since 1.4.0 the alarm settings live here too, and all of them have working
# defaults — this list is only for changing them:
#
#     ALARM_AFTER_SECONDS=180     how long a node may be unreachable before
#                                 the dashboard goes red and the phone rings
#     STARTUP_GRACE_SECONDS=300   how long the pool may take to come up at all
#     ALARM_REPEAT_HOURS=6        how rarely a standing alarm is repeated
#     STALL_RESTART_MINUTES=15    exit-and-restart after a silent wedge; 0 off
#     AUX_LONGPOLL=0              stop following dogecoin's tip by longpoll and
#                                 go back to polling it alone
#
# Keys not listed in ALLOWED below are ignored on purpose. This file is sourced
# into umbrelOS's own shell while it starts apps: a stray PATH= or
# APP_DOGECOIN_NODE_RPC_PASS= line in a hand-edited .env must not be able to
# reach into that shell, and `set -a; . .env` would let it.
