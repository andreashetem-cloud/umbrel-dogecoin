# Mutation testing: proof that the suites fail when the code is wrong.
#
# A passing test suite says nothing on its own. Two of this repo's tests were
# once VACUOUS — they passed against code that did nothing — and the way that
# was found was by breaking the code and watching them pass anyway. This script
# does that on purpose and in CI: it takes a copy of the tree, makes one
# specific, plausible mistake in it, runs the suite that is supposed to catch
# that mistake, and fails if the suite still passes.
#
# Every mutant below is a bug someone could actually write, not a random
# character swap. The comment on each says which single check is meant to die.
#
#   ./test/mutants.sh            all mutants
#   ./test/mutants.sh health     only mutants whose name contains "health"
