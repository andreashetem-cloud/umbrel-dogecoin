# The identifier below is a fixed literal on purpose. Do NOT "tidy" it into
# "env-${app_entropy_identifier}-RPC_PASSWORD": umbrelOS sets that variable to
# "app-doge-dogecoin-node-seed", so the interpolated form would produce a
# DIFFERENT identifier, a different derived password, and every wallet pointed
# at this node would stop authenticating. The string is the contract.

# status is reported, not derive_entropy's, so a derive_entropy failure can
# never abort the app start under umbrelOS's `set -euo pipefail`.
