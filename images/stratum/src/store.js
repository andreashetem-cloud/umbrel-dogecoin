// Durable statistics.

// A solo miner runs for years and finds a block on a timescale of decades. If
// the numbers reset every time the container restarts — an update, a reboot, a
// power cut — the dashboard can only ever describe the last few hours, which is
// the least interesting window there is. This module keeps the history on disk.
//
// Design rules, in order of importance:
//   1. Losing the file must never stop the app from mining. Every failure here
//      is logged and swallowed.
//   2. Never destroy history we cannot read. A corrupt file, or one written by
//      a newer version, is preserved and the store goes read-only rather than
//      overwriting years of records.
//   3. A write must never publish a half-written file: temp, fsync, rename.
//   4. Nothing grows without bound — not the file, not memory, not the log.

  //
  //   * The block records. They are the record of money, they are what
  //     reconciliation compares against the node at every startup, and

  //     them would not zero a counter, it would delete the evidence that a
  //     block was ever mined. Nothing in this app deletes those.
  //   * firstStartedAt. "Mining for 8 months" is a fact about the machine, not
  //     a statistic about shares.
  //   * Each worker's `work`, the lifetime sum of credited difficulty. It is
  //     not a share counter: it is the denominator of the "work done" figure
  //     and of the luck percentage, and it is the natural partner of the block
  //     count that is deliberately kept. Zeroing it while keeping blocksFound
  //     leaves `1 block found, 8.0e+10% luck` on the dashboard — a number that
  //     is not merely reset but wrong, and unrecoverable without mining for as
